##MetalSite Project

This project is built using **React.js** with **Vite** as the development server, and it utilizes **Redux** for efficient state management. The application is styled with **Material UI** for a modern and responsive design.

## Hosting Information

- **Frontend**: Hosted on [Netlify](https://metalsite.netlify.app)
- **Backend & Database**: Hosted on Render. (Currently, I am working to resolve issues caused by a recent update that led to the loss of the database. I will restore it as soon as possible.)

## Project Overview

This project aims to minimize backend calls, reducing costs and optimizing performance, leveraging the skills I've acquired during my Fullstack Bootcamp.
